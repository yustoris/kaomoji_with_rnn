Kaomoji Generator with Recurrent Neural Network 
==========

## What's this? ##
An auto Kaomoji generator, which learns existing Kaomojis with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and is implemented by employing only primitive `numpy` functions.

## Requirements ##
### Python environment ###
- Python3
- numpy

### kaomojis ###
A text file whose each line contains one Kaomoji (or AA).
Over 1,000 lines file should be preferable (I used 7,320 lines file).

## How to execute ##
Firstly you must prepare a file and libraries which are described in "Requirements" above.

Once you meet the requirement, `python3 ./rnn.py` is the only thing to do, enjoy!
